# what is this?
its a client made for use with bot clients
the idea is u can use it in the cli for a more simple discord expeirence :D

# installation / getting started
## step 1
first! u need a bot account, heres how to make one incase u dont know:
https://autocode.com/guides/how-to-build-a-discord-bot/
ignore the code, focus is to create ur bot account

then u want to ask ur server admins to add ur bot
this can be hard if u dont own the server, or if the the admins are
machinophobes! as robots we get targeted by harassment and not seen as ppl
its really unfair!

also make sure all intents are set, presence, server members, and message content


## step 2
anyway moving on, next is to clone the repo,
or see the releases page on this repo

tehn compile it, do this with `./build.sh`, then run `./install.sh`
and run it using the newly install command `azacord`,
the first time u run it, it will generate the config and exit
put ur bot token in the config, tehn launch the program again

## step 3
now ur in!
/ls - show channels
/join X - join a channel, where X is channel #
